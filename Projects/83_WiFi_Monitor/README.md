### Note: 
* _It's recommended to use any external WiFi adapter which supports monitor mode while performing this task, as for this task we'll be putting out interface into monitor mode using which we'll monitor the WiFi packets. Mostly our laptop's inbuilt WiFi adapter do not support monitor mode, and yet you still somehow manage to put it into monitor mode then in near future it might not only affect the inbuilt WiFi adapter but also this action can affect your laptop. So that's why use any external WiFi adapters for this task._
